Assumumption : 
We have a structure of node type having two fields , info field of type int and next field of node type pointer.
We Already have a link-list. We have to only count the no of elements in link-list.
We have node type pointer start which have starting address of link-list.

step-1 : START
step-2 : Declare node type pointer temp
step-3 : Set temp to start
step-4 : Set count to 0
step-5 : Repeat Step 6-7 untill temp Not Equals NULL
step-6 :  Set count equals count+1
step-7 :  Set temp equals to next field of temp
step-8 : PRINT count
